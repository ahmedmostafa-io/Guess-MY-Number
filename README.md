# 🎯 Guess My Number Game

A simple and fun number guessing game built with _HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript_ as part of the _JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann_.

## 🧠 Concept

You have to guess a _secret number_ between _1 and 20. With each guess, you'll receive feedback to help you reach the correct number. The game also tracks your \*\*current score_ and _high score_.
